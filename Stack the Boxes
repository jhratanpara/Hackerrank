#Here's an image of four models. Some of the cubes are hidden behind other cubes. Model one consists of one cube. Model two consists of four cubes, and so on...

#Stack the Boxes

#Write a function that takes a number n and returns the number of stacked boxes in a model, visible and invisiblewhere n is levels high.


def stack_boxes(n):
		levels_high=n
		total=int(n**2)
		invisible=int((n-1)**2)
		visible=int(total-invisible)
		return n
		print(levels_high)
		print(invisible)
		print(visible)
